        About our game
    </h1>
    <p>
        The program my partner and I created is a mock-up of flappy birds created in Khan Academyâ€™s version 
        of javascript. <br> 
        To use it, the user selects start. Once they have done so, they control a bird jumping
         over pipes. The bird only has to jump over one pipe, but it respawns, and over time moves quicker. 
         If the bird comes into contact with a pipe, the game ends. The objective is to last as long as possible,
          but as time goes on this becomes increasingly difficult.<br> 
        To achieve this end, we used functions, variables,
        objects, and arrays to make the game run properly and smoothly.
